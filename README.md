# Nimbuzz Project Plan

## Project Objective

Create a proof of concept (POC) for **Nimbuzz**, an AI-powered web application designed to enhance the current claim submission portal for agents. The goal is to simplify the process by providing an interactive, minimalist UI that guides users through claim selection and submission using AI-driven prompts and dynamic audio feedback.

---

## High-Level Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js (React) or Nuxt.js (Vue.js) for seamless server-side rendering.
- **Design**:
  - Modern, minimalistic UI with dynamic annotations.
  - Progress indicators to notify users upon completion of each form section.
- **Interactions**:
  - Communicates with AI APIs for guidance.
  - Implements Text-to-Speech (TTS) services for audio feedback.

### Backend

- **Server**: Node.js handling business logic and API interactions.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Data validation and error handling.
  - Communication with external services (AI models, TTS services, and APIs).

### AI Integration

- **AI Models**: Utilize AI for generating prompts and processing user inputs.
- **Services**: Integrate with TTS services for dynamic, natural-sounding audio feedback.

---

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Setup

- **Initialize Repository**:
  - Create a Git repository named `nimbuzz`.
  - Set up the project using Next.js (`npx create-next-app nimbuzz`) or Nuxt.js (`npx create-nuxt-app nimbuzz`).

- **Install Dependencies**:
  - **Frontend Libraries**: React or Vue.js, UI components (Material-UI, Vuetify).
  - **Backend Libraries**: Express.js (if needed), Axios for API calls.
  - **AI and TTS SDKs**: Services like OpenAI for AI prompts, Google Cloud TTS, or Amazon Polly.

### 2. Design the UI

- **Landing Page**:
  - Simple interface with options to select claim types (wellness, sickness, cancer, accident, etc.).
  - Use intuitive icons or buttons for easy navigation.

- **Form Pages**:
  - Minimalist design with clear input fields divided into sections.
  - Dynamic annotations that highlight and explain each part as the user navigates.

- **Progress Indicators**:
  - Display completion status of each form section.
  - Notify users upon completion of each part.

### 3. AI Integration

- **AI Prompt Design**:
  - Craft conversational prompts to guide users through the claim submission process.
  - Include predefined rules and context to ensure accurate and helpful responses.

- **API Communication**:
  - Frontend captures user inputs and sends them to the backend.
  - Backend communicates with the AI API, processes the response, and sends it back to the frontend.

### 4. Dynamic Audio Feedback

- **TTS Integration**:
  - Convert AI text responses into speech using a TTS service.
  - Ensure the voice is natural and matches the application's tone.

- **Audio Playback in UI**:
  - Implement audio players that automatically play AI responses.
  - Synchronize audio with visual cues in the UI for enhanced user engagement.

### 5. Data Handling and Validation

- **Client-Side Validation**:
  - Provide immediate feedback on user inputs (e.g., required fields, format checks).

- **Server-Side Validation**:
  - Ensure data integrity and security before processing submissions.
  - Handle any discrepancies or errors gracefully.

- **Error Handling**:
  - AI offers specific guidance on how to correct errors.
  - Visual indicators highlight fields needing attention.

### 6. API Integration for Data Submission

- **Mock APIs**:
  - Create mock endpoints to simulate backend interactions during the POC.

- **Real API Integration** (Optional for POC):
  - Connect to actual APIs if available to demonstrate full functionality.

- **Conditional API Calls**:
  - Backend decides when to make additional API calls based on user inputs and AI guidance.

### 7. Testing and Optimization

- **Functional Testing**:
  - Verify each feature works as intended.
  - Test AI interactions for accuracy and helpfulness.

- **Performance Testing**:
  - Optimize latency in AI responses and audio playback.

- **User Feedback**:
  - Conduct user testing sessions to gather insights and make improvements.

### 8. Deployment

- **Hosting Platform**:
  - Use services like Vercel (ideal for Next.js) or Netlify.

- **Environment Variables**:
  - Securely manage API keys and configuration settings.

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
  - Set up pipelines for streamlined deployments.

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

- **Latency in AI Responses**:
  - **Solution**: Optimize network requests; consider pre-fetching or caching mechanisms.

- **Synchronizing Audio and UI**:
  - **Solution**: Ensure event handlers properly synchronize audio playback with UI changes.

- **Error Handling Complexity**:
  - **Solution**: Clearly define error scenarios and corresponding AI responses during planning.

- **Security Concerns**:
  - **Solution**: Use HTTPS, validate all inputs on the server side, and securely manage API keys.

## Future Enhancements

- **Voice Recognition**:
  - Incorporate Speech-to-Text for voice command inputs.

- **Advanced AI Interactions**:
  - Enable complex dialogues and decision-making capabilities.

- **Integration with Real APIs**:
  - Connect with actual backend services for full functionality.

- **Accessibility Features**:
  - Implement screen reader support and keyboard navigation.
